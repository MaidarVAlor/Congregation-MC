# Congregation MC
### welcome!
made by mva(em-vee-ay), welcome to this pack's GitHub page.

the Congregation MC is a sound pack that resembles the [popular Geometry Dash meme, the Congregation Jumpscare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XesMzhRg_g).
in this pack, there is a chance of getting jumpscared by the song's drop sequence.

starting from version **v1.1**, visual jumpscare appears when trying to wear carved pumpkin.

### features
it's just 1 feature... it's made to jumpscare. there is a chance that the song will play. all the other songs (except the music disks) are _MUTED_.

in 1.19, there is 4.761% chance that the jumpscare will kick in since there are 21 base music files which one of them is replaced with the song.
![1 out of 21 files contains the song, you can see that because the 20k files are just silence and the 5m122k file is the one with a song](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/ce819a7f50b86bbc00985bd1e7ef7953ed869a2d.png)

in 1.20 (and .21), it's *exactly* 4% chance for the song to play because there are 25 music files.

_**note that this DOES NOT COUNT THE "creative", "end", "nether", "swamp" and "water" SOUND FOLDERS which also contain audio files.**_

## trivia
1. this pack was made in 10 minutes, which 3/4 of that time was invested in copying files and renaming them.
2. it is around 5 megabytes big. that's it.
3. normally, i wanted to lower the volume of the jumpscare by few dBs to make it less scary but since i wanted this pack to be a meme, i left the song file in original state.
